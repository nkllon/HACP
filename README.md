# HACP (Human-Agent Collaboration Protocol)

HACP is the canonical public protocol: schemas, normative spec, and reference implementation. It defines the Task Manifest, Role & Capability Declaration, and Decision Envelope that all HACP-compatible systems must implement. The core is Apache 2.0 and intended to be the neutral substrate for interoperability.

## Repository Structure

* `packages/hacp-schema`: Python reference implementation of the HACP schemas.
* `spec`: Normative specifications (coming soon).
